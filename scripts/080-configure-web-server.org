# We set an environment variable called blockAccess.

# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents Foswiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other Foswikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
#
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying to crawl your Foswiki
#
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker blockAccess
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ blockAccess
